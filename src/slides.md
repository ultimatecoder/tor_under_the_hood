## Tor Relays

* Entry node (Guard node)

  * Remains for 2-3 months

  * Knows who is requesting

  * Doesn't know what is requested

* Middle node

  * Forwards request from Entry node to Exit node

  * Forwards response from Exit node to Entry node

  * Doesn't know who is requesting and what is responded

* Exit node

  * The one who actually resolves the request

  * Don't know who requested

  * Knows what is requested

* List of relays

---

## Bridge

* A special type of Tor relays that is not publicly listed

* Helps in connecting to Tor network if it is blocked by ISP or any level

* Bridges are geo distributed located

* It is difficult to get addresses of all the bridges

---

## Onion routing

* Client builds circuit first

* Generates three individual shared symmetric keys for all three relays in
  circuit.

---

## Onion Service

* Location of the service is hidden yet accessible

* Domain of the service ends with ".onion"

* Dot onion services are only accessible via Tor network

* Requests is routed only through Tor relays

## Myths of Tor


---

## I am just watching YouTube videos. Should I use Tor?


---

## If I use Tor, I am not hackable

---

## I don't bother if someone is using my data because I am not doing anything illegal


---

## Tor is funded by U.S. Government. I am sure they knows hidden ways to crack Tor
