# Components of Tor 🔮

## Tor Relays 🌀

* Entry node (Guard node)

  * Remains for 2-3 months

  * Knows who is requesting

  * Doesn't know what is requested

* Middle node

  * Forwards request from Entry node to Exit node

  * Forwards response from Exit node to Entry node

  * Doesn't know who is requesting and what is responded

* Exit node

  * The one who actually resolves the request

  * Don't know who requested

  * Knows what is requested

* List of relays are publicly available

---

## Bridge 📡

* A special type of Tor relays that is not publicly listed

* Helps in connecting to Tor network if Tor is blocked by ISP or any level

* Bridges are GEO distributed

* It is difficult to get addresses of all the bridges

## Onion Service

* Location of the service is hidden yet accessible

* Domain of the service ends with ".onion"

* Dot onion services are only accessible via Tor network

* Requests is routed only through Tor relays
